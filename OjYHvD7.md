### REVIEW:
_What is animation?_
To animate means to bring to life. An animation is the process of making a stationary object appear to move on it's own.

_Why did the flipbook animation make it look like the characters were moving?_
Afterimage makes it so that our eyes remember the previous picture for about 1/32 second after it is shown. That, combined with the new image, makes it appear as if it moving.


### INTRODUCE:
_What is stop motion animation?_
Stop Motion animation is a process that is similar to the flipbook except that instead of flipping a page, the computer will be playing a series of pictures very quickly. An example of an upcoming movie that utilizes stop motion animation is the film Boxtrolls.

Over the next six weeks students will be creating their own stop motion animation videos. They will learn how to storyboard, create, and edit their videos. To start watch some examples.

### WATCH:
Show students the [Box Trolls Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfm4uPESCoI). When it is finished discuss the attention to detail and patience that goes into making a stop motion video. For further examples, any of the other video from the stop motion examples section above can be shown.

### CHECK FOR UNDERSTANDING:
Share with a partner how the process for making a stop motion animation is similar to making a flipbook. 

### CREATE:
Distribute the Stop Motion Challenge handout to students. The instructions for creating the first stop motion are:

1. Place the first lego in the view of the camera
2. Take a picture
3. Add a lego
4. Take a picture
5. Repeats steps 3and 4 until you have at least 40 pictures and a full lego tower.

### WATCH:

To watch the stop motion:

1. Select the first picture in Photobooth
2. Hold the arrow keys on the keyboard to make the pictures animate just like the flipbook.

### EXPLORE:
If you finish, create a second animation of the tower falling apart or shrinking using the same process.
