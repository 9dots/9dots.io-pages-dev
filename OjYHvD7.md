## Setup

### Materials

- Computers with Minecraft installed
- Minecraft Shelter handout
- Minecraft Shelter powerpoint

## Empathize
Day 1 of your Minecraft adventure. Review design thinking as a process to identify and solve problems in one's community. 

1. Go through each term and ask for a student defintions. After, have students write down each definition in their handout. 
	- Empathize: The work you do to understand people, within the context of your design challenge; gives confidence you are working on a meaningful problem
	- Define: Based on what you know, craft a meaningful problem statement; brings clarity and focus to the design space
	- Ideate: concentrate on idea generation; design many diverse solutions to develop and test
	- Prototype: Begin building; gives confidence that your solution meets the need you uncovered
	- Test: show don’t tell and always get feedback.

2. Introduce scenario: You’ve crashed! You and your crew are shipwrecked on a mysterious island with limited supplies. You only know one thing about this island: it is covered with MONSTERS! Though this is scary, they only come out at night. Today you must work together to build a shelter before nightfall. Your shelter must include:
	- A threshold to enter and exit the shelter
	- 4 walls (at least)
	- Space for windows and looking outside 
	- Roof
	- Light (lanterns)

3. Discussion question: How do you think it would feel to be in this situation?

## Define
Survival has been turned on in our server, meaning shelter is required. 

1. Turn [Survival Mode](http://www.wikihow.com/Play-Minecraft) on (directions listed under #2 of the wikilink).
2. Students discuss with partners what the problem is and they should write a problem statement on their worksheet. 

## Ideate
1. Students will use the dedicated space in the [Day 1: Shelter Handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Or0DeLh.gdoc) to begin to design their shelters. Students should draw in squares, since they will be using only cubes in the Minecraft world.

2. Students will think about how big their house should be, where to place their windows and door, how large their shelter will be, etc. 

3. Discuss which partner will construct what when gameplay begins (collaboration is critical).

## Prototype
After having developed their ideas and designs, students will construct their shelters in Minecraft.

1. Students will login to Minecraft as a Student.

2. Students will work together to build their structures using the resources supplied by the instructor. It is important students build efficiently as danger approaches during the night. 

## Test/Feedback
Discussion questions:

- Were you successful in building your shelter? Why or why not? 
- What challenges did you run into during gameplay? 
- What would you change about your shelter in the future? 

## Standards
Standard | Description | Connection
--- | --- | ---
3-5-ETS1-1 | Define a simple design problem reflecting a need or a want that includes specified criteria for success and constraints on materials, time, or cost. | Define
3-5-ETS1-2 | Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem. | Ideate
MS-ETS1-2 | Evaluate competing design solutions using a systematic process to determine how well they meet the criteria and constraints of the problem. | Prototype
