## Introduce

### HOOK:
_What is a hinge?_
A **hinge** is a type of bearing that connects two solid objects, typically allowing only a limited angle of rotation between them.

### OBSERVE:
As a class, chart out things that are “Hinges in the body” and “Not hinges in the body,” as well as “Hinges in the room” and “Not hinges in the room.”

### GOALS:
Today, students will learn how to build hinges on their robots. By the end of the lesson, students will have moveable parts on their robot.

## Guided Practice

### THINK PAIR SHARE:
With a partner, students will discuss how hinges could be useful for the robot that they are designing.

### PLAN:
Students will go back to their blueprints and highlight where all of the hinges will be used in their designs.

### SHOW:
Show students an example of how to connect cardboard pieces using the MakeDo hinges.

## Explore

### PRACTICE:
On some spare cardboard, students will practice putting together hinges.

### BUILD:
Students will continue building their cardboard robots with a focus on adding the moveable parts.
