blurb: "In Minecraft Day 1(http://www.9dots.io/9dots/OqtrDDl) students built shelters for survival. In Minecraft Day 2(http://www.9dots.io/9dots/OpIX5X6), students learned how to farm their own food. Now, students will gain the skills required to build tools and various survival resources. A link for the crafting guide is listed below. \n\nFor more information on crafting check out this Crafting Guide(http://www.minecraft-crafting.net/)"

## Setup

### Materials

- Computers with Minecraft installed
- Minecraft Mining handout
- Minecraft Mining powerpoint

## Empathize
Day 3 of your Minecraft adventure. Students will engage in design thinking to solve their problem of limited resources. As the instructor, supply students with a pick axe to allow them to quickly mine for materials.

1. You’ve survived 2 days! You have managed to make shelter, harvest food, and now your task is even greater. You’re resources are running low and your shelters are bare and unsustainable. It is time you begin mining and gathering your own materials to begin crafting goods. 

2. Discussion question: Why is this day important? What real-world scenarios can this relate to?

## Define
Though we have shelter, resources are limited, so we must rely on our environment and crafting resources. 

1. Students discuss with partners what the problem is and they should write a problem statement on their worksheet. 

## Ideate
1. Students will use the dedicated space in the [Day 3: Shelter Handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Or0vuHE.gdoc) to begin to write down items they think will be necessary.

2. After initial input, students will open the [Crafting Resource Guide](http://www.minecraft-crafting.net/). Instruct students they must craft the following:
	- Crafting table
	- Bed
	- Boat 
	- Stone slabs
	- Wooden slabs
    - Compass

3. Using the [Crafting Resource Guide](http://www.minecraft-crafting.net/), students will write down the "ingredients" required for each item to be constructed on their [Day 3: Shelter Handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Or0vuHE.gdoc).

## Prototype
After having learned how to define their inputs for various tools and resources, students will begin to mine for materials in Minecraft and construct their tools.

1. Students will login to Minecraft as a Student.

2. Students will work together to find the materials needed and begin crafting their required list of materials. 

## Test/Feedback
Discussion questions:

- Were you successful in mining? 
- What challenges did you run into as you were playing? 
- Why was this a necessary skill to learn? 
- How did you work together to make this process easier?

## Standards
Standard | Description | Connection
--- | --- | ---
3-5-ETS1-1 | Define a simple design problem reflecting a need or a want that includes specified criteria for success and constraints on materials, time, or cost. | Define
3-5-ETS1-2 | Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem. | Ideate
MS-ETS1-2 | Evaluate competing design solutions using a systematic process to determine how well they meet the criteria and constraints of the problem. | Prototype
