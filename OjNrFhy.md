- [Stop Motion Inspiration](http://vimeo.com/1105462)
- Computer with Photo Booth and iMovie (or other picture taking application)
- Editing checklist

### Preparation:
- Bring checklists from Editing: Day 1

## Lesson

### DO NOW:
Students will take 3 minutes at the beginning of the project to make a list of edits that they would like to add for their last day.

### WORK:
Students will break into their groups and be handed their editing checklist.  For the rest of the project time, groups will finish editing their videos. Make sure that students are using the checklist to ensure that their video surpasses the minimum requirements.

### FINISHED EARLY:
If a group finishes editing their video before the project time is up, they will become ‘tutors’ to help groups that are struggling to finish in time. If more than one group is finished, they will watch each other’s movies and write down their two favorite things.

### GALLERY WALK:
If all of the groups finish before the end of the project time, students will go on a gallery walk and watch other videos around the room. Again students will write down their two favorite parts of the videos that they see.
