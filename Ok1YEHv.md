## Media and Handouts

- Powerpoint presentation

## Preparation

- print worksheets

## Project Time

- 40 minutes

## Introduce

### Hook:
Watch clip from the show [Shark Tank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va_YvHaewOc). Briefly explain the show to the students.

### Goal:
Today, students will be starting a brand new unit in which they will be designing their own products.  At the end, they will present their products to judges, just like the show Shark Tank, and the judges will choose which product they think should win.

## Guided Practice

### Discuss:
_What is a product?_
A **product** is something that is sold to people to satisfy a need or a want.

_What are ways that people can get ideas for designing new products?_ Brainstorm idea on the board.

### Explain:
For this unit, we will be getting ideas from nature.  Using examples from nature to solve human problems is called **biomimicry**.

### Brainstorm:
After showing examples, have students brainstorm examples of biomimicry that they can think of from real life.

### Goal Update:
The goal for this unit will be to think of a product that does not exist that is inspired by a certain animal.  Students will then make a poster and pitch their product to the judges.

### Example:
Snails have a shell that their whole body can fit inside to protect them.  Maybe this would inspire be to develop a helmet that can expand to protect a personâ€™s entire body rather than just their head.

## Explore

### Partners:
Assign students partners. Once they have formed their group, students will choose an animal from a hat.

### Research:
Students will read worksheet on their animal. When they have finished, they will fill out the worksheet, highlighting three things about the animal that could be interesting to inspire a product.

### Share Out:
Each group will share the three interesting facts that they found about their animal with the group.
